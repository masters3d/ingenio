## Career

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career#Etymology) the word career comes from the latin _carrus_ which means chariot. The chariots of our time (cars) are powered by engines. The main purpuse of a car is to provide movement in a similar manner that a carrer is meant to provide progression of one profession. 

## Progression

It is not clear why most software engineers obtain a Computer Science degree given that most Software Engineer do not bocome Computer Engineers. If I want to become a chemical engineer, I go to school for a Chemical Engineering degree or if I want to choose academia I can become a PHD in Chemestry. This is not the case for Software Engineering.
