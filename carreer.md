## Career

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career#Etymology) the word career comes from the latin _carrus_ which means chariot. The chariots of our time (cars) are powered by engines. The main purpose of a car is to provide movement in a similar manner that a career is meant to provide progression of one profession. 

## Progression

It is not clear why most software engineers obtain a Computer Science degree given that most Software Engineer do not become Computer Engineers. If I want to become a chemical engineer, I go to school for a Chemical Engineering degree or if I want to choose academia I can become a PHD in Chemistry. This is not the case for Software Engineering.



## People Levels
It is important to understand the many different levels that software engineer are being in industry are arbitrary. Taking a look at a website like [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) we can see that even between companies, there is no standard about career progression. For sake of argument, I will use arbitrary numbering systems to depict the different levels and try to show how each level in many way is a different job altogether.

The most familiar titles for these levels are Senior, Principal, Staff. Each level is a different job description.

### Level 0

### Level 1

### Level 2

### Level 3

## Level 4
