## Engines and Motors

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine#Terminology), the word engine comes from the Latin  _ingenium_ which is the root word for ingenious.

In spanish, there is not direct translation for the word engine. The closest translation is _motor_ which is the same word used in english to also mean engine.  Motor comes from the latin verb _movere_ which is the root of the word motion. An Engine or Motor's final goal is to move matter. The industrial revolution came due to the inventions of Engines/Motors that allowed humans to transform raw materials to mechanical movement which replaced human manual labor.

It is not a coincidence that engine and engineer only differ by the letters er at the end. The word engineer shares the same latin root of _ingenium_ with engine. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_engineering) an _engineâ€™er_ literally meant someone one who operates an engine. The word engineer has evolved from somebody who operated machines of war, steam engines operators, to its current meaning of somebody who uses applied sciences to create and operate machines.  Humanity took the engineering title forward into the third industrial revolution (The digital revolution) to depict folks who create and manager digital engines that are no longer tied to hard physical objects. 

With this little history of the origins of the words, we could consider engineers as folks who are incharge of setting and keeping things in motion. In an alternatives universe we might have used the term motorer to refer to engineer.

## Software Engineering

Engineering is a well established profession with many different branches. Usually these are tided to real word tangible things like bridges or rockets. As of 2020s, software is embedded in most human related technology from coffee makers to space exploration robots. The idea of software engineering as a profession is difficult to explain to more established engineering regulatory bodies. In the USA most software engineers are not professional  engineers like on other locales where the title is reserved for licensed engineers. 

The digital revolution starts around the time of the transistor become available in the 1950 but it only starts to take off around 1970 when microtransitor become widely available.  It is around this [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) that software engineering as a profession is born. 

The field of software engineering is only 50 years young (as of 2020's). Most software engineers have computer science (CS) degrees just like CS folks in the past had to get physics and math degrees because there was no computer science departments.  In the future as Software Engineering (SE) matures, I forsee software engineering departments being created in universities that will tackle the needs of the future. 

SE is so diverse that it is hard predict on what level of the stack an engineer is going to working on when hired. For the vast majority of cases software engineering is more about systems engineering than it is about computer science. Distributed Software Engineering Systems can be complex and require the same level of thinking as any other system. 

## Levels
It is important to understand the many different levels that software engineer are being in industry are arbitrary. Taking a look at a website like [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) we can see that even between companies, there is no standard about career progression. For sake of argument, I will use arbitrary numbering systems to depict the different levels and try to show how each level in many way is a different job altogether.

The most familiar titles for these levels are Senior, Principal, Staff. Each level is a different job description.

### Level 0
Newly hired person (or apprentice) individual contributor (IC) with some kind of expectation of being fully productive within the next 4months.

### Level 1
A productive member of the IC team who is able to create component given design documents.

### Level 2

An IC who is able to contribute to other folks components and it is able to design components tha can then be implements for other folks in the team. Able to interoperable with other teams components and create changes required for collaboration.

### Level 3

An IC who is entrusted with a system of components and is able to guide the systems live cycle.

## Level 4

An IC who helps other folks update and maintain a system of components. Is able to integrate a current system with another team system of components.

## Level 5
An IC who designs systems of components that are then implemented by other teams. This person usually helps with multiple systems. 

## Level 6
And IC who is able to make progress in systems of system who belong with in sister teams. 

## Level 7+
And IC who is able to make process in system of system where the systems go all the way go down.
