## Engines and Motors

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine#Terminology), the word engine comes from the Latin  _ingenium_ which is the root word for ingenious.

In spanish, there is not direct transttion for the word engine. The closest translation is _motor_ which is the same word used in english to also mean engine.  motor comes from the latin verb _movere_ which is the root of the word motion. An Engine or Motor's final goal is to move matter. The industrial revolution came due to the inventions of Engine/Motors that allowed humans to transform raw materials to mechanical movement which replaced human manual labor.

It is not a coicidence that engine and engineer only differ by the letters er at the end. The word engineer shares the same latin root of _ingenium_ with engine. In an alternatvies universe we might have used the term motorer to refear to engineer.

With this little history of the origins of the words, we could consider engineers as folks who are encharged of setting and keeping things in motion.  

## Software

Engineering is a well stablished profession whith many different branches. Usually these are tided to real word tactable things like bridges or rockets. As of 2020s, software is enbeeded in most human related technology from coffee makers to space exploration robots. The idea of software engineering as a profession is difficult to explain to more stablished engineering regulatory bodies. In the USA most software engineers are not licensed engineers like on other countries where the title is reseved for professional engineers.
