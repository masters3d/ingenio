Will be using mermaid.js to create some graphics embedded in markdown files. In cases
where the inlined markdown preview does not work, please use the below extension to
open the .mmd files.

VS Extension used:
<https://github.com/tomoyukim/vscode-mermaid-editor>

Another great draw.io is another great tool.
VS Extension used: <https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio>

For presentation it will be good to automate the code to png creating so all versions
update.
