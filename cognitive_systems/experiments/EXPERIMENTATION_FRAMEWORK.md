# Cognitive Experimentation Framework

## Vision
Create a systematic approach to developing, testing, and evolving cognitive agent capabilities through controlled experimentation and autonomous discovery.

## Experimental Philosophy

### TARS-Inspired Testing
Following the TARS model from Interstellar - intelligent experimentation with:
- **Humor Setting**: Test how personality affects collaboration
- **Honesty Parameter**: Explore transparency vs. efficiency trade-offs  
- **Autonomy Levels**: Validate independent operation capabilities
- **Mission Alignment**: Ensure goals remain aligned during evolution

### Meta-Experimental Approach
- **Experiments on Experiments**: Test how to design better experiments
- **Self-Designing Studies**: Agents that create their own tests
- **Emergent Discovery**: Allow unexpected findings to guide research
- **Recursive Improvement**: Use results to improve the experimental process
