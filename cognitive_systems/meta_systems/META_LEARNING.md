# Cognitive Meta-Learning Systems

## Vision
Create self-improving cognitive systems that autonomously enhance their own learning capabilities, inspired by the meta-cognitive abilities seen in TARS and CASE from Interstellar.

## Meta-Learning Architecture

### Core Concept: Learning to Learn
Meta-learning is the process by which cognitive agents improve their own learning mechanisms. Instead of just learning new information, they learn better ways to learn.

### Meta-Learning Levels

#### Level 1: Learning About Learning
- **Self-Monitoring**: Track what learning strategies work
- **Strategy Recognition**: Identify different learning approaches
- **Effectiveness Measurement**: Evaluate learning outcomes

#### Level 2: Learning Strategy Adaptation
- **Strategy Selection**: Choose optimal learning approaches for different contexts
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rates and methods
- **Context Awareness**: Recognize when to change learning strategies

#### Level 3: Learning Strategy Creation
- **Novel Strategy Generation**: Create new learning approaches
- **Strategy Combination**: Merge existing strategies in novel ways
- **Innovation**: Develop breakthrough learning methods

#### Level 4: Meta-Meta-Learning
- **Learning About Meta-Learning**: Improve the meta-learning process itself
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Enhance the enhancement mechanisms
- **Cognitive Bootstrapping**: Self-modifying cognitive architectures

## Implementation Framework

### Meta-Learning Components

#### 1. Learning Strategy Repository
```yaml
strategies:
  pattern_recognition:
    method: "neural_pattern_matching"
    effectiveness: 0.85
    context: ["visual_data", "sequence_data"]
    
  analogical_reasoning:
    method: "structural_mapping"
    effectiveness: 0.78
    context: ["conceptual_learning", "problem_solving"]
    
  experiential_learning:
    method: "trial_and_error_with_reflection"
    effectiveness: 0.92
    context: ["skill_acquisition", "real_world_tasks"]
```

#### 2. Meta-Learning Engine
```python
class MetaLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy_repository = StrategyRepository()
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
        self.strategy_selector = StrategySelector()
        self.strategy_creator = StrategyCreator()
    
    def learn_task(self, task, context):
        # Select optimal learning strategy
        strategy = self.strategy_selector.select(task, context)
        
        # Execute learning
        result = strategy.learn(task)
        
        # Track performance
        self.performance_tracker.record(strategy, result)
        
        # Meta-learn from experience
        self.meta_learn(strategy, result, context)
    
    def meta_learn(self, strategy, result, context):
        # Analyze what worked and why
        effectiveness = self.analyze_effectiveness(result)
        
        # Update strategy parameters
        self.strategy_repository.update_strategy(strategy, effectiveness)
        
        # Consider creating new strategies
        if self.should_create_new_strategy(effectiveness, context):
            new_strategy = self.strategy_creator.create(context, effectiveness)
            self.strategy_repository.add(new_strategy)
```
