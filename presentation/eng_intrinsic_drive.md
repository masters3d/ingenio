# Motivations

>"I tell my engineers that the biggest problems we have to solve are not technical problems, but people problems. Modernization projects take months, if not years of work. Keeping a team of engineers focused, inspired, and motivated from beginning to end is difficult."
Marianne Bellotti (Kill It with Fire)
