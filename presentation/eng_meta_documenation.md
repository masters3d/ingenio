# What is documentation?

You may think that documentation is self-explanatory, but you more than likely are wrong. Nobody agrees on what is documentation and what is required and what is nice to have. Let's us take some time and document documentation.

## Documentation types

There are two uber types: 
- (External/Consumer) Customer documentation
- (Internal/Producer) Engineering documentation

Customer documentation is a whole other ball game. We will discuss Engineering Documentation.

## Engineering documentation

## Private to the team Documentation

- ramp-up guides for new team members
    - dev environment set up
    - access to resources (permissions)
    - recorded videos of onboarding
- trouble shooting guides
   - These are called TSG at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/how-to-mitigate-the-incident-an-effective-troubleshooting-guide-recommendation-technique-for-online-service-systems/)
   - Usually needed once a service is online/production and requires some kind of support.
