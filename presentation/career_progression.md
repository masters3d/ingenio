# People Systems

> An important truth that's often hard for software engineers to understand: technical systems are mostly made of people. The people who design the product. The people who write the code. The people who maintain the code. The people who use the product. Technical artifacts are transient edges. The nodes they connect are human beings. So take care of your people. Have empathy for your users, have empathy for your team. Create people-centric systems. This is always my #1 piece of advice to software engineers. And usually the most disregarded one
