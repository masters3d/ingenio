# What is context?

- Past events recorded to be passed down to the future.
- Contextual
    - It depends on when, where.
- Static and Dynamic
    - Static wrt past revisions. Dynamic wrt to now.


# End goals
- Highlight behaviors that maximize context sharing
-  Stablish patterns to detect gaps in context and how to keep context alive


# Context about context
- It's contexts all the way down



# Etymology of context

- Root Latin `contextus`, from `con`- ‘together’ + `texere` ‘to weave’.
- Same root word as text.



# Human Context w.r.t Engineering product

- Folks Contributing (We will focus here)
- Folks using product



# Folks Contributing

- Async vs synchronous contribution
- ReadWrite vs ReadOnly
- Short Term vs (Mid to Long term) 
    - Fixing a bug vs Maintainer 



# Async Context ReadWrite Medium 

- Text
    - Markdown, Wiki, Word
- Visual
    - Graphics
        - Drawings
            - Paint app, photo of markerboard/smartboard, vector app.
    - Presentation
        - PowerPoint Slides
- Interactive
    - PR collaboration
    - Word document comments
    - Email



# Async Context ReadOnly Medium 

- Audio/Visual
    - Recorded presentation
- Documentation Website (No process to contribute)
    - Guides
        - Troubleshooting Guides
        - Tutorials



# Synchronous Context Medium
- Realtime Collaboration. 
    - Meeting, live chat, in person conversation
- Single use. Need to repeat for every new person or group of folks.
- Doesn't scale but they are useful.


# Desired qualities of context sharing
- Available in asynchronous medium in a way that is easy for the consumer and to contribute updates.
- Subject matter experts are available over asynchronous communication to help clarify questions. Sync meetings can be arranged on case by case basis as need arises (this should enhance asynchronous communication)
