* It is up to you to control this narrative.

<!---::: notes
* ~12 years as of 2021
* Young professional figuring how to get paid for doing what I love
* Our professional life may take different paths but the journey is the same

* Ability: Work hard. Leadership and confidence. Support sales people to sell more structures.
* Learnings: International Travel is overrated. A company (where you work) should not be part of your identity. Money as a primary motivation did not work for me.

<!---::: notes
* It is the manifestation of your _why_ you did something. Why you do what you do. Why will you do it again in the future. 
* It is the story of how you did something. How you are doing that thing now. And how you plan to improve.
* It is socializing ideas. Building communities. Leaving your mark in this world.
