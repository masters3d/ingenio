# Why this talk?

* Since Pandemic I started to feel disconnected with work so I started to search for answers. 
* I wanted to find ways to make my job more enjoyable while also having the greatest impact.
* I want to grow as an engineer and also help others on the way.

---

# How

* I will show you (3) behaviors groups that helped me feel back in control of my projects and career.
* These are things that worked for me and I hope can get something out of these ideas to develop your own behaviors.
* Everybody is different. This is just one perspective.

---

# Dimensionality

* People scalar (Person, Team, Group)
* Software scalar (Component, Cluster, System)
* Time scalar (Short, Medium, Long)

---

# Scope
* People and Software from same team.
* Time scale of short to medium term.

---

# Meta Procedure

- We will start with the individual person and a singular project (component).
- We will explore current, short term future, medium term future
- We will do a temporal shift to past (current), present (short term), future (medium term)
- This part is well understood

---

# Meta Stage

- We will start with the individual person and a singular project (component).
- We will explore current, short term future, medium term future
- We will do a temporal shift to past (current), present (short term), future (medium term)
- This part is well understood.

---

# Meta Stage Next

- We will continue with the singular person but we will introduce multiple projects at different levels of progress.
- Some projects are fun while others are not.
- How does this individual feel motivated? (now add a pandemic on top of this)
- This part is somewhat understood.

----

# Meta Stage Redo

- We will imagine a team of individuals (each with different systems of components) that need to interact with each other. 
- New people being added, and people moving teams, projects changing ownership. 
- Team and software over time.
- This part is not well understood.

# Behavior #1: Clear Strategy

* Clear goals. (Know what to do next). 
* Clear signal of progression towards goals (Tight feedback loop)
* Challenging within margin of skill (Not too hard or easy. Just right) 
* Full control over the activity (Ownership / Authority)

# Clear Strategy

* Agile methodology attempts to address this.
* Definition of done
* User Stories
* Iterative progress
* Well understood as Ability.
  - Can I do it? 

---

# Behavior #2: Intrinsic Drive

* Sense of Ownership 
* Feeling of Autonomy.
* Mastery (always improving)
* Somewhat understood as Motivation
  - Is it worth it?

# Intrinsic Drive

* Beyond Mission, Vision statement from company. 
* Motivation that can only be intrinsic to the individual.
* Can not come directly from delegation. 
* External motivations like money only temporarily boots motivation.


---

# Behavior #3:  Contextual Awareness

* The act of seeking awareness (as input) across the scalar dimensionality of people, software components, and time.
* The act of transporting awareness outside of their contextual environment into the short, medium term future.
* Not well understood
  - akin to human consciousness but for human software systems.
