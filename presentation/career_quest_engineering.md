# Career

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career#Etymology) the word career comes from the latin _carrus_ which means chariot. The chariots of our time (cars) are powered by engines. The main purpose of a car is to provide movement in a similar manner that a career is meant to provide progression of one's profession.

Most folks think of a career ladder when thinking bout this.

# Engineering

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine#Terminology), the word engine comes from the Latin  _ingenium_ which is the root word for ingenious.

It is not a coincidence that engine and engineer only differ by the letters er at the end. The word engineer shares the same latin root of _ingenium_ with engine. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_engineering) an _engine’er_ literally meant someone one who operates an engine.
