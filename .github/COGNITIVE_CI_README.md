# 🧠 Cognitive CI System - GitHub Actions Integration

## Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow implements **INGENIO-1**, a Level 4 cognitive agent that automatically processes GitHub issues and converts them into comprehensive engineering specs using the Three Pillars Quest Engine framework.

## How It Works

### 🔄 Automated Triggers

The cognitive processor runs automatically when:

1. **Issue Events**: 
   - New issue opened
   - Issue edited
   - Issue labeled

2. **Scheduled Processing**:
   - Daily at 2 AM UTC
   - Processes all open issues

3. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Workflow dispatch from GitHub Actions tab
   - Option to force reprocess all issues

### 🧠 Cognitive Processing Flow

1. **Issue Fetching**: Retrieves all open GitHub issues
2. **Cognitive Analysis**: Applies Three Pillars framework analysis
3. **Spec Generation**: Creates comprehensive VISION.md documents
4. **Meta-Learning**: Updates cognitive insights and patterns
5. **Commit & Archive**: Saves all analysis to repository

### 📁 Generated Artifacts

For each processed issue, the system creates:

```
specs/{spec_name}/
├── VISION.md           # Comprehensive vision document
├── METADATA.yml        # Structured analysis data
└── README.md           # Spec overview and next steps
```

Additional cognitive artifacts:
```
experiments/cognitive_sessions/{session_id}/
├── SESSION_CONTEXT.yml    # Complete session data
├── SESSION_RESULTS.yml    # Processing results
├── COGNITIVE_TRACE.md     # Detailed thinking process
└── META_LEARNING.md       # Insights and improvements
```

## 🎯 Three Pillars Application

Each issue is analyzed through the Three Pillars Quest Engine:

### 1. Clear Strategy
- **Vision**: Problem statement and objectives extraction
- **Goals**: Actionable goal identification from issue content
- **Scope**: Complexity estimation and domain mapping
- **Exit Criteria**: Success metrics and completion definition

### 2. Intrinsic Drive
- **Mastery**: Learning opportunities and skill development areas
- **Autonomy**: Ownership clarity and decision points
- **Purpose**: Business value and user impact assessment

### 3. Contextual Awareness
- **Documentation**: Requirements and audience identification
- **Observability**: Monitoring and measurement needs
- **Communication**: Stakeholder and communication patterns
- **Economics**: Resource requirements and time estimation

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Manual Workflow Trigger

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Cognitive Issue Processor" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Options:
   - **Force all**: Reprocess all open issues
   - **Specific issue**: Process only one issue number

### Automatic Processing

The system automatically processes issues when:
- You create a new issue
- You edit an existing issue
- You add labels to an issue

### Monitoring Cognitive Activity

Check the cognitive dashboard:
- Look for the "🧠 INGENIO-1 Cognitive Agent Dashboard" issue
- Automatically updated after each processing cycle
- Shows processing statistics and insights

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The workflow uses these GitHub secrets/variables:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- Repository settings are extracted from the action context

### Cognitive Agent Settings

Configure the agent behavior in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "cognitive": {
    "agent": "INGENIO-1",
    "level": 4,
    "framework": "Three Pillars Quest Engine",
    "capabilities": [
      "autonomous-issue-processing",
      "spec-driven-development", 
      "meta-learning"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Quality Metrics

The cognitive agent tracks:
- **Processing Efficiency**: Issues processed per minute
- **Framework Application Success**: Three Pillars analysis quality
- **Average Confidence**: Cognitive analysis confidence scores
- **Spec Generation Rate**: Successful spec creation percentage

## 🔄 Meta-Learning Capabilities

INGENIO-1 continuously improves by:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from issue analysis patterns
- **Process Refinement**: Improving spec generation quality
- **Confidence Calibration**: Better accuracy in analysis assessment
- **Framework Enhancement**: Evolving Three Pillars application

## 🤝 Human-Cognitive Collaboration

### Audit and Debug
- All cognitive decisions are transparent in session logs
- Human reviewers can understand agent reasoning
- Session context enables cognitive process debugging

### Collaborative Enhancement
- Humans can provide feedback through issue comments
- Agent learns from human corrections and preferences
- Continuous improvement through human-agent collaboration

## 🔐 Security and Permissions

The workflow requires these permissions:
- `contents: write` - To create and update spec files
- `issues: read` - To fetch and analyze GitHub issues
- `pull-requests: write` - For future PR automation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No specs generated**: Check if issues contain enough content for analysis
2. **Permission errors**: Verify GitHub token has required permissions
3. **Workflow not triggering**: Check workflow file syntax and triggers

### Logs and Debugging

- View workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Check cognitive session files in `experiments/cognitive_sessions/`
- Review cognitive trace files for detailed agent reasoning

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the workflow**: Manually trigger to see cognitive processing
2. **Create a test issue**: See the agent analyze and generate specs
3. **Review generated specs**: Validate cognitive analysis quality

### Future Enhancements
1. **Design Phase**: Add DESIGN.md generation capability
2. **Implementation Phase**: Auto-generate implementation plans
3. **Quality Enhancement**: Improve cognitive analysis depth
4. **Multi-Agent**: Deploy multiple cognitive agents for collaboration
