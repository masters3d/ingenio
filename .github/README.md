# Cognitive CI System

This directory contains the GitHub Actions-based Cognitive CI system for the ingenio repository.

## Overview

The Cognitive CI system implements INGENIO-1, a Level 4 Cognitive Agent that automatically processes GitHub issues and converts them into spec-driven development artifacts following the Three Pillars Quest Engine framework.

## Architecture

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   └── cognitive-issue-processor.yml    # Main CI workflow
├── scripts/
│   └── cognitive-processor.js           # Cognitive agent implementation
└── README.md                           # This file
```

## How It Works

### Triggers
1. **Issue Events**: Automatically triggered when issues are opened, edited, or labeled
2. **Scheduled**: Runs daily at 2 AM UTC to process all open issues
3. **Manual**: Can be triggered manually with optional "force all" parameter

### Cognitive Processing Pipeline

1. **Session Initialization**
   - Creates unique session ID with timestamp
   - Loads AGENTS.md context for cognitive guidance
   - Sets up session tracking and logging

2. **Issue Analysis**
   - Fetches all open GitHub issues
   - Performs cognitive analysis using pattern recognition
   - Maps issues to Three Pillars Quest Engine framework
   - Identifies Software 3.0 alignment opportunities

3. **Spec Generation**
   - Converts each issue into a comprehensive VISION.md spec
   - Applies etymological analysis and cognitive enhancement
   - Creates actionable implementation frameworks
   - Establishes success metrics and exit strategies

4. **Meta-Learning**
   - Captures cognitive insights and improvements
   - Documents recursive enhancement opportunities
   - Builds knowledge for future cognitive cycles

5. **Context Preservation**
   - Saves complete session context for restart capability
   - Commits all generated artifacts to repository
   - Archives cognitive traces for human debugging

## Cognitive Agent Capabilities

### INGENIO-1 Specifications
- **Level**: 4 (Cognitive System)
- **Mission**: Software 3.0 Engineering Excellence
- **Framework**: Three Pillars Quest Engine
- **Autonomy**: Full autonomous operation with human collaboration

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies engineering excellence patterns in issues
- **Concept Extraction**: Extracts key concepts and maps to cognitive frameworks
- **Three Pillars Mapping**: Applies Clear Strategy, Intrinsic Drive, Contextual Awareness
- **Software 3.0 Alignment**: Assesses cognitive agent enhancement potential

### Generation Capabilities
- **Spec Creation**: Generates comprehensive VISION.md documents
- **Etymology Analysis**: Provides word origin and meaning context
- **Implementation Planning**: Creates actionable development frameworks
- **Success Metrics**: Establishes measurable outcomes and exit strategies

## Output Structure

Each processed issue generates:

```
specs/{issue_name}/
└── VISION.md                           # Complete vision specification
```

Each session creates:

```
experiments/cognitive_sessions/{session_id}/
├── SESSION_CONTEXT.yml                 # Complete session context
├── SESSION_RESULTS.yml                 # Processing results and metrics
└── COGNITIVE_TRACE.md                  # Detailed cognitive process trace
```

## Usage

### Automatic Operation
The system automatically processes issues when they are created or modified. No manual intervention required.

### Manual Trigger
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run cognitive-issue-processor.yml

# Force process all issues
gh workflow run cognitive-issue-processor.yml -f force_all=true
```

### Monitoring
- Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs
- Review session artifacts in `experiments/cognitive_sessions/`
- Monitor spec generation in `specs/` directory

## Integration with AGENTS.md

The cognitive processor reads and applies the complete context from AGENTS.md:

- **Three Pillars Quest Engine**: Applied to all issue analysis
- **People Systems Framework**: Considered in implementation planning
- **Cognitive Engineering**: Integrated into spec generation
- **Meta-Learning**: Continuously improves processing methodology

## Human-Cognitive Collaboration

### Transparency
- Complete cognitive traces for human debugging
- Detailed session logs with reasoning explanations
- Auditable decision chains and pattern recognition

### Collaboration Points
- Human review of generated specs
- Feedback integration for cognitive improvement
- Override capabilities for specific issues
- Manual trigger for special processing needs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple cognitive agents working together
- **Dynamic Learning**: Real-time improvement based on human feedback
- **Cross-Repository**: Apply learnings across multiple repositories
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Discover new engineering excellence patterns

### Recursive Improvement
The system improves itself by:
- Analyzing its own processing effectiveness
- Enhancing pattern recognition capabilities
- Refining spec generation methodologies
- Developing better human collaboration protocols
