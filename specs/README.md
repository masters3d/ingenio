# Specs Directory - Spec-Driven Development for Engineering Excellence

This directory contains specifications following the **Quest Engine Framework** for systematic development of engineering excellence concepts.

## Spec-Driven Development Process

Following the **Clear Strategy** pillar, each spec follows this architecture:

```
Vision Document → Design Document → Sprint Plan → Daily Plan
```

## Current Specifications

### Priority 1 - Core Framework Enhancement
- **[PIE_theory_integration/](./PIE_theory_integration/)** - Performance, Image, Exposure framework integration
- **[behavior_alignment/](./behavior_alignment/)** - Guiding policies creation and enforcement systems  
- **[action_feedback_adjustment/](./action_feedback_adjustment/)** - Fundamental feedback loop frameworks

### Priority 2 - Engineering Leverage
- **[engineering_leverage/](./engineering_leverage/)** - Bicycle of the mind concepts and applications
- **[quality_engineering_approach/](./quality_engineering_approach/)** - QE vs QA mindset transformation

### Priority 3 - Systems and Processes  
- **[feature_lifecycle_management/](./feature_lifecycle_management/)** - Cradle to grave development processes
- **[documentation_systems/](./documentation_systems/)** - Personal lab notebooks and open guides
- **[design_governance/](./design_governance/)** - Working groups and review processes

## Spec Template Structure

Each specification directory contains:

```
spec_name/
├── VISION.md           # Problem statement, goals, success criteria
├── DESIGN.md           # Technical approach and implementation details  
├── IMPLEMENTATION.md   # Sprint planning and execution roadmap
├── DAILY.md           # Concrete next steps and actions
└── RESEARCH.md        # Etymology, references, background context
```

## Three Pillars Application

Every spec must address:

### Clear Strategy
- **Vision**: Why this matters for engineering excellence
- **Design**: How to implement systematically  
- **Sprint Planning**: Actionable development phases
- **Daily Actions**: Concrete next steps

### Intrinsic Drive
- **Mastery**: How this builds engineering capabilities
- **Autonomy**: Individual ownership and decision-making
- **Purpose**: Connection to meaningful engineering outcomes

### Contextual Awareness  
- **Documentation**: Async knowledge sharing approaches
- **Observability**: Metrics and feedback mechanisms
- **People Systems**: Individual → Team → Group → Organization scaling
- **Economics**: Sustainable knowledge commons

## Development Lifecycle

1. **Issue Identification**: Extract from GitHub issues or engineering challenges
2. **Vision Creation**: Define problem, goals, and success criteria
3. **Design Development**: Technical implementation approach
4. **Sprint Planning**: Break into manageable development phases  
5. **Daily Execution**: Concrete actions and next steps
6. **Feedback Integration**: Action-feedback-adjustment cycles
7. **Documentation**: Knowledge capture and sharing

## Quality Standards

### Spec Quality Criteria
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps for implementation
- **Contextual**: Considers different organizational levels
- **Sustainable**: Can be maintained and evolved over time
- **Coherent**: Aligns with Three Pillars Quest Engine framework

### Engineering Excellence Standards
- **Systems Thinking**: Shows interconnections and dependencies
- **Behavioral Focus**: Emphasizes behaviors over abstract concepts
- **Scalable Communication**: Async-first documentation approach
- **Etymological Grounding**: Understanding word origins and meanings

## Contributing to Specs

### For Agents
1. **Start with AGENTS.md**: Understand repository context and philosophy
2. **Apply Framework**: Use Three Pillars Quest Engine consistently  
3. **Research Etymology**: Understand word origins for key concepts
4. **Consider Scale**: Individual → Team → Group → Organization implications
5. **Document Opinions**: Clearly mark subjective content
6. **Focus on Behaviors**: Actionable engineering behaviors

### For Humans
1. **Read Existing Specs**: Understand current patterns and approaches
2. **Open GitHub Issues**: Discuss new concepts before spec creation
3. **Follow Template**: Use standard spec structure for consistency
4. **Apply Three Pillars**: Ensure Clear Strategy, Intrinsic Drive, Contextual Awareness
5. **Review and Iterate**: Use feedback loops for continuous improvement
