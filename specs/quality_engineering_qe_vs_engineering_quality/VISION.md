# Quality Engineering [QE] vs Engineering Quality

**Status**: Vision Phase  
**Issue**: #25  
**Cognitive Agent**: INGENIO-1  
**Framework**: Three Pillars Quest Engine  
**Focus**: Software 3.0 Engineering Excellence

## Mission Statement

Transform the engineering challenge "Quality Engineering [QE] vs Engineering Quality" into a cognitive agent-enhanced system that autonomously improves engineering excellence through recursive meta-learning and human-cognitive collaboration.

## Problem Statement

**Core Challenge**: Quality Engineering [QE] vs Engineering Quality

**Engineering Context**: The main difference between QE and QA is that we don't separate Quality from the responsibility of the software engineer. We make quality part of the product instead of deferring this responsibility to a different team. The same is true for security. Security is part of what an engineer's role. We don't have a separate security engineering team that is responsible for this. Similar to documentation (which we can general as context), we don't have a documentation team, each engineer is responsible to provide this context at all the levels that is needed. 

 This mind set change needs to apply to rewarding systems. Let's reward behaviors and not gaming the system and getting lucky to work on highly visible work. We need better systems to measure behaviors that we want to reward so these behaviors can continue.  



From CoPilot:

The terms “engineering quality” and “quality engineering” might sound similar, but they refer to different concepts:
Engineering Quality refers to the inherent characteristics of a product or system that allow it to meet certain standards or specifications. It’s about the end result and ensuring that the product or system functions as intended and is free from defects.
Quality Engineering (QE), on the other hand, is a proactive approach that involves integrating quality practices into the product development process. [It’s about setting up systems and processes to ensure that every stage of production meets quality standards, thereby preventing defects before they occur](https://theqalead.com/quality-engineering-planning-strategy/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance/)[1](https://theqalead.com/quality-engineering-planning-strategy/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance/).
[In essence, while engineering quality is focused on the quality of the final product, quality engineering is concerned with the processes that ensure this quality throughout the development lifecycle](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance)[2](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance). Quality engineering is a broader concept that includes quality assurance but also encompasses other aspects like quality planning and quality control. [It’s a more holistic approach that aims to build quality into the product from the ground up](https://theqalead.com/quality-engineering-planning-strategy/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance/)[1](https://theqalead.com/quality-engineering-planning-strategy/quality-engineering-vs-quality-assurance/).



**Cognitive Enhancement Opportunity**: How can cognitive agents autonomously improve the concepts in "Quality Engineering [QE] vs Engineering Quality"?

**Software 3.0 Alignment**: This challenge represents an opportunity to demonstrate how cognitive agents can autonomously enhance human engineering capabilities, moving beyond traditional software development to intelligent, self-improving systems.

## Etymology & Context

Etymology: "Engineering" from Latin ingenium (cleverness), root of "ingenious" and our repository name "ingenio". Engineering represents the application of intelligence to solve problems.

**Cognitive Connection**: This etymological understanding informs how cognitive agents can autonomously reason about and improve engineering practices.
