# PIE Theory Integration - Issue Context

**Original Issue**: Add PIE Theory Integration to Quest Engine Framework

## Problem Statement

The PIE theory (Performance, Image, Exposure) serves as a valuable framework for career development, emphasizing the importance of not only personal performance but also how one is perceived and the visibility one has within their professional environment. This theory can complement the existing Quest Engine model, which is built around the three pillars of Clear Strategy, Intrinsic Drive, and Contextual Awareness. By integrating PIE theory concepts, we can enhance the career growth guidance provided in this repository, offering users a more holistic approach to their professional development.
