# feat: Filter spec generation by "Ingenio-1" label only, exclude PRs, and create pull requests

**Status**: Vision Phase  
**Issue**: #37  
**Cognitive Agent**: INGENIO-1  
**Framework**: Three Pillars Quest Engine  
**Focus**: Software 3.0 Engineering Excellence

## Mission Statement

Transform the engineering challenge "feat: Filter spec generation by "Ingenio-1" label only, exclude PRs, and create pull requests" into a cognitive agent-enhanced system that autonomously improves engineering excellence through recursive meta-learning and human-cognitive collaboration.

## Problem Statement

**Core Challenge**: feat: Filter spec generation by "Ingenio-1" label only, exclude PRs, and create pull requests

**Engineering Context**: The cognitive issue processor automation was processing all open issues and committing specs directly to the main branch. This PR implements selective processing with "Ingenio-1" label filtering and PR exclusion, while creating pull requests for review instead of direct commits.

## Changes Made

### Single Label Filtering
Modified the `fetchOpenIssues()` method to fetch issues with only "Ingenio-1" label and exclude pull requests from processing:

```javascript
const { data: allItems } = await this.octokit.issues.listForRepo({
  owner: this.repoOwner,
  repo: this.repoName,
  state: 'open',
  per_page: 100,
  labels: 'Ingenio-1'  // Fetch issues with "Ingenio-1" label only
});

// Filter out pull requests - only process actual issues
const issues = allItems.filter(item => !item.pull_request);
```

### Pull Request Workflow
Completely redesigned the automation to create PRs instead of direct commits:

- **Branch Creation**: Each spec gets its own feature branch (`cognitive/spec-{name}`)
- **Isolated Development**: Changes are committed to feature branches, not main
- **PR Generation**: Automated pull requests with comprehensive cognitive analysis descriptions
- **Review Process**: Enables human review before merging specs into the main codebase

### Enhanced Issue Updates
Updated issue comments to link to the created pull requests instead of just referencing generated files:

```markdown
### Generated Artifacts
- üîÄ **Pull Request**: [#42 - Generate spec for "PIE Theory Integration"](https://github.com/repo/pull/42)
- üìÅ **Spec Directory**: `pie_theory_integration`
- üìÑ **Vision Document**: VISION.md with comprehensive framework
```

### Workflow Updates
Removed the automatic commit step from the GitHub Actions workflow since commits now happen within the PR creation process on feature branches.

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests validating:
- Label filtering processes issues with "Ingenio-1" label only
- Pull requests are completely excluded from processing (only actual issues are processed)
- PR creation workflow generates proper branch names and descriptions
- All existing cognitive agent functionality remains intact

Test results: 7/7 tests passing (100% success rate)

## Impact
- **Single Label Support**: Only issues marked with "Ingenio-1" are processed by the automation
- **PR Exclusion**: Pull requests are filtered out, ensuring only actual issues are processed
- **Better Code Review**: All generated specs go through PR review process
- **Improved Collaboration**: Human reviewers can examine and approve cognitive-generated specifications
- **Maintained Quality**: All existing Three Pillars Quest Engine functionality preserved

Fixes #36.
