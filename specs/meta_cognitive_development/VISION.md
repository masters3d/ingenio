# Meta-Cognitive Development Framework

## Etymology & Vision Context

**Meta** (Greek: _meta_ = beyond, about): Higher-level abstraction or self-reference  
**Cognitive** (Latin: _cognoscere_ = to get to know): Knowledge acquisition and processing  
**Development** (French: _développer_ = to unwrap): Gradual growth and improvement

## Problem Statement

Traditional development frameworks assume static capabilities and external improvement processes. Meta-cognitive development enables systems that:

1. **Learn How to Learn**: Improve their own learning processes recursively
2. **Self-Assess Capabilities**: Understand their own strengths, limitations, and potential
3. **Autonomously Improve**: Enhance capabilities without external intervention
4. **Transfer Meta-Learning**: Apply learning strategies across different domains
5. **Collaborative Meta-Intelligence**: Share meta-learning insights with other cognitive systems

## Meta-Learning Hierarchy
