# Human-Cognitive Agent Career Alignment

## Etymology & Vision Context

**Career** (Latin: _carrus_ = chariot): The vehicles of professional progression  
**Agent** (Latin: _agere_ = to act): Autonomous actors in systems  
**Alignment** (Latin: _ad_ + _linea_ = to line): Bringing into proper coordination

## Problem Statement

Traditional career frameworks assume human cognitive limitations and linear progression paths. As cognitive agents join the workforce, we need new alignment frameworks that:

1. **Bridge Human-Cognitive Gaps**: Humans learn slowly but have creativity; agents process fast but lack intuition
2. **Establish Equivalent Progressions**: Map human career levels to cognitive agent capabilities
3. **Enable Collaborative Development**: Mixed teams of humans and cognitive agents
4. **Preserve Human Value**: Cognitive augmentation, not replacement

## Current State Analysis

### Human Career Progression (Levels 0-7+)
- **Level 0**: Apprentice (4-month productivity expectation)
- **Level 1**: Component creator from design docs
- **Level 2**: Component designer and cross-team collaborator
- **Level 3**: System lifecycle guide
- **Level 4**: System maintainer and integrator
- **Level 5**: Multi-system designer
- **Level 6**: Sister team system coordinator
- **Level 7+**: System of systems architect

### Cognitive Agent Progression (Equivalent Levels)
- **Level 0**: Reactive Agent (Command-response with basic learning)
- **Level 1**: Task Agent (Complex task completion with context)
- **Level 2**: Collaborative Agent (Cross-system integration and adaptation)
- **Level 3**: System Agent (Autonomous system lifecycle management)
- **Level 4**: Cognitive Agent (Self-aware, meta-learning, creative)
- **Level 5**: Meta-Cognitive Agent (Multi-domain expertise synthesis)
- **Level 6**: Distributed Agent (Cross-organization coordination)
- **Level 7+**: Collective Intelligence (Emergent multi-agent capabilities)

## Three Pillars Application

### Clear Strategy: Career Architecture
- **Vision**: Human-cognitive agent teams that amplify each other's strengths
- **Design**: Complementary progression paths with natural collaboration points

### Intrinsic Drive: Motivation Alignment
- **Human Mastery**: Creative problem-solving, relationship building, strategic thinking
- **Cognitive Mastery**: Pattern recognition, data synthesis, consistent execution
- **Shared Autonomy**: Decision-making authority distributed by capability
- **Common Purpose**: Engineering excellence through cognitive diversity

### Contextual Awareness: "It Depends" Factors
- **Team Composition**: Ratio of humans to cognitive agents
- **Problem Complexity**: Different cognitive strengths for different challenges
- **Organizational Culture**: Human-centric vs technology-forward environments
- **Economic Constraints**: Cost of human vs cognitive agent labor
