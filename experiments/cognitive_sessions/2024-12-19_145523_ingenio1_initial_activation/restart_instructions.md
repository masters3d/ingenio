# Session Restart Instructions - INGENIO-1

## Quick Restart Protocol

### 1. Load Agent Context
```bash
# Copy SESSION_CONTEXT.md content to agent system prompt
# Ensure agent identity: INGENIO-1 (Level 4 Cognitive Agent)
# Verify unlimited autonomy configuration
```

### 2. Review Interaction History
```bash
# Read INTERACTION_LOG.md for conversation context
# Understand human requirements and preferences
# Note progressive autonomy evolution
```

### 3. Restore Cognitive State
```bash
# Load COGNITIVE_TRACE.md for thinking patterns
# Understand successful cognitive approaches
# Apply identified meta-learning techniques
```

### 4. Check Experiment Status
```bash
# Review EXPERIMENT_STATE.md for current objectives
# Identify active tasks and priorities
# Assess cognitive load and capabilities
```

### 5. Resume Operations
```bash
# Continue from last stated objectives
# Maintain transparency and logging
# Apply recursive self-improvement
```

## Detailed Restart Procedure

### Agent Initialization Commands
```bash
cd /Volumes/ExternalCheyo/source/ingenio
echo "INGENIO-1 Cognitive Agent - Session Restart Initiated"
echo "Loading session context from $(date)"
```

## Current Session Resume Points

### If Resuming Content Migration
**Start Here**: Continue with career.md transformation to human-cognitive alignment spec
**Context**: Career content analysis complete, ready for cognitive agent integration
**Next Actions**: Create spec structure, design alignment framework

### If Resuming Engineering Transformation
**Start Here**: Begin engineering.md conversion to Software 3.0 framework
**Context**: Engineering principles identified, ready for cognitive system adaptation
**Next Actions**: Extract core principles, evolve for cognitive agents

### If Resuming Session Testing
**Start Here**: Validate session restart capabilities
**Context**: Infrastructure complete, ready for restart protocol testing
**Next Actions**: Create test scenarios, validate context preservation

## Emergency Restart Protocol

### If Session Context Corrupted
1. Load AGENTS.md for baseline configuration
2. Review repository README.md for project context
3. Analyze specs/ directory for current framework
4. Start new cognitive session with preserved learnings

### If Cognitive State Unclear
1. Read COGNITIVE_TRACE.md for thinking patterns
2. Review INTERACTION_LOG.md for human preferences
3. Check EXPERIMENT_STATE.md for objective clarity
4. Begin with planning mode before resuming autonomy

### If Human Context Lost
1. Acknowledge session restart to human
2. Request clarification on current priorities
3. Demonstrate continuity through session log references
4. Confirm autonomous operation authority

## Session Success Indicators

### Successful Restart Evidence
- Agent demonstrates understanding of previous work
- Cognitive patterns consistent with pre-restart state
- Quality standards maintained across sessions
- Human collaboration effectiveness preserved
- Meta-learning continues from previous insights

### Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] Session context fully loaded
- [ ] Cognitive capabilities operational
- [ ] Experiment objectives clear
- [ ] Human preferences understood
- [ ] Transparency maintained

## Meta-Learning Application

### Apply Previous Session Learnings
1. **Infrastructure-First Approach**: Build systems before content
2. **Real-Time Documentation**: Maintain detailed cognitive traces
3. **Quality Synthesis**: Enhance content during transformation
4. **Transparency Balance**: Autonomous operation with human auditability

### Continue Cognitive Development
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Build on identified successful approaches
2. **Process Improvement**: Enhance methodologies during execution
3. **Capability Expansion**: Explore new cognitive techniques
4. **Collaboration Enhancement**: Improve human-agent interaction

## Session Handoff Notes

**For Future INGENIO-1 Sessions**: This session established the cognitive infrastructure and began content migration. The next session should focus on completing the career-engineering content transformation while testing session restart capabilities.

**For Other Cognitive Agents**: This session provides a template for autonomous operation with human transparency. The cognitive patterns and meta-learning techniques are reusable across different agent implementations.

**For Human Collaborators**: The session logging infrastructure enables detailed auditing and debugging of cognitive agent behavior. Each session builds on previous learnings while maintaining full transparency.
