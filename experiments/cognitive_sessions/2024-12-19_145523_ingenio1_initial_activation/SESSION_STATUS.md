# COGNITIVE SESSION MOVED

## New Location
All cognitive session logs have been moved to:
```
/experiments/cognitive_sessions/2024-12-19_145523_ingenio1_initial_activation/
```

## Session Structure
- `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Agent instructions and configuration
- `INTERACTION_LOG.md` - Human-agent conversation history
- `COGNITIVE_TRACE.md` - Agent thinking process and decision chains
- `EXPERIMENT_STATE.md` - Current objectives and progress
- `restart_instructions.md` - How to resume this session

## Current Session Status
**Active Session**: 2024-12-19_145523_ingenio1_initial_activation  
**Phase**: Infrastructure Complete ✅
