# INGENIO Cognitive Agent Experiments

## Experiment Logging System

This directory contains detailed logs of all cognitive agent experiments conducted in the ingenio repository. Each experiment is designed to be:

- **Auditable**: Clear reasoning and decision trails
- **Debuggable**: Step-by-step thinking and process logs
- **Replicable**: Detailed methodologies and parameters
- **Educational**: Learning extracted for future agents

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment follows this structure:
```
experiments/
├── YYYY-MM-DD_experiment_name/
│   ├── EXPERIMENT_LOG.md       # Real-time experiment log
│   ├── HYPOTHESIS.md           # Initial hypothesis and goals
│   ├── METHODOLOGY.md          # Approach and methods used
│   ├── RESULTS.md              # Findings and outcomes
│   ├── LEARNINGS.md            # Meta-learnings about the process

## Experiment Guidelines

### For Cognitive Agents
1. **Log everything**: Document thinking, decisions, failures
2. **Be transparent**: Show reasoning chains clearly
3. **Extract meta-learnings**: Learn how to learn better
4. **Create replicable methods**: Enable future agent success

### For Human Auditors
1. **Check EXPERIMENT_LOG.md first**: Real-time activity log
2. **Review thinking/ directory**: See agent reasoning
3. **Validate RESULTS.md**: Assess experiment success
4. **Use LEARNINGS.md**: Understand process improvements

## Meta-Learning Objectives

- Improve cognitive agent development methodologies
- Enhance human-agent collaboration protocols
- Discover emergent intelligence patterns
- Build self-improving engineering excellence systems
